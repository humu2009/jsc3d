# JSC3D in Applications #

## Online Ring Customization ##

_**Princeton Ring**_ provides an online ring design interface where a client can fully customize and preview a new alumni ring. After an order placement, the result is generated immediately using the draft from the previous step with 3D printing. Then it will be polished and delivered. _JSC3D_ is integrated into the online design system for presenting each new ring.

## Hygiene Product Display ##

_**Berendsen Textil Service A/S**_ uses _JSC3D_ for online display of their hygienic solutions. The virtual environment of a washroom has been set up based on pictures and videos as well as a series of hot spots that navigate to the hygiene facilities. On the close view of each facility, there is a hot spot linking to a 3D view of this product, where its detailed and customizable model will be displayed.

## Interactive View of Facial Sculptures ##

_**IvarFace Technology**_ fused the cutting-edge 3D scanning and 3D printing technology and brings them to sculpture art. They provide statue production service for ones who would like their faces to be shaped on sculpture that looks like ancient Greek or Roman style. Face data is captured by fast 3D scanning. Then after some post processing, a high quality facial sculpture is printed out using inexpensive 3D printing technique. _JSC3D_ is adopted to provide interactive preview of face models generated from 3D scanning.

## Review of User Submitted Models before 3D Printing ##

_**3D Printing @ Columbia**_ is a research project that allows people to upload interesting models (in STL format) to be 3D printed freely. When a model is submitted, it will be displayed using _JSC3D_ in a review page to take snapshots. The model will then be added into the gallery where visitors can view all submitted stuff and vote for their favorite masterpieces. The most up-voted models will be put to printing with a _MakerBot Replicator 2_ 3D printer.

## Online Interactive Crystal Research ##

_**Smorf Crystals**_ puts effort to collect and arrange information of crystal minerals and put them online in a way easy to view and search. They also provide 3D printing service of crystal models for researchers. _JSC3D_ is adopted there for presenting structures of various crystals.

## In-browser CAD Modeling Tool ##

_**OpenJSCAD-soprano**_ is an experimental branch of the _OpenJSCAD_ project, which aims to provide a distinctive CAD tool for modellers to generate solid 3D models online. Unlike other modeling softwares, most of which are designed for artists, _OpenJSCAD_ is focusing on an industrial aspect: it accepts a snippet of script and generates 3D models from it using constructive solid geometry (CSG) method. Existing models from files (STL, AMF, etc.) are also acceptable. With _JSC3D_, the tool runs smoothly on most browsers with or without WebGL.

## Delivery of 3D Content in E-Learning System ##

The _**Learning and Teaching Centre (LTC)**_ and the _**Department of Ancient History**_ of _**Macquarie University**_ create a project to develop a fully online course for students of Egyptology through the use of 3D scanned artefacts. The _LTC_ has a skilled team to capture high definition scans of ancient artefacts and prepare them for inclusion in their _iLearn_ system. _JSC3D_ as a key component is used to establish a web based interface that works across browsers and mobile devices for delivery of 3D content. These provide a highly authentic learning experience. A workflow has been refined along the development of this project, which is considered to be furtherly reused in more online course design.

## Online Luggage Store ##

_**UGOBAGS**_ is an innovative company focusing on improving experience of travelling by providing distinctive luggage service that invites customers into the design of luggages. On website of their store, a web based platform has been developed where a well-designed standard suitcase model is shown, together with a dozen of options via which one can custumize the basic model and add in personal elements to make it individual. All configurations are interactive. Changes are shown immediately after an option has been modified. The most inspiring part is that a customer can choose a picture for the cover of a suitcase, either from his/her own painting or from the library provided by artists of _UGOBAGS_. As its display component, _JSC3D_ works perfectly in the luggage configuration platform.

## Display of Driven Equipments ##

_**Техпривод**_ is a solution providing company that offers products and service of driven equipments in Russia and CIS countries. From the long list of their products, some are digitized to generate 3D models and put online with detailed discriptions and paramenters. _JSC3D_ works on the product pages for interactive display of these equipment models in 3D.

## Illustration of Nanostructures ##

_**Colouratom**_ is a research project launched by the _EMAT group_ at the _University of Antwerp_, to explore complex nanosystems on the atomic scale, using the most advanced electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction technology. The project is expected to enlighten the design of new types of nanomaterials, based on in-depth understanding of physical behaviour at the quantum mechanical level. The team uses _JSC3D_ to set up online showcase for their research.

## Virtual Museum ##

_**Paweł Wojnarowski IT**_ and the _**Foundry Reaserch Institute in Krakow**_ add to their online museum new exhibits of casting artefacts from ancient ages. Visitors can click into an item to be navigated to the corresponding artefact that is displayed in an interactive view powered by _JSC3D_. The models are coded in STL files, some of which are really large and really detailed (with more than 700,000 facets).
